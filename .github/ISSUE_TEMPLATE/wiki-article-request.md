**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
As a contributor to this repository, I want to read the INSERT_WIKI_ARTICLE on the GitHub Wiki, so that I am aware of what is expected of me.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A GitHub Wiki page of the INSERT_WIKI_ARTICLE. It should also be easily accessible from the Wiki sidebar.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Storing it on Google Drive - this would result in needless navigation away from GitHub.

**Additional context**
None.
